                "Traveling is the great true love of my life. I am loyal and constant in my love of it. I feel about travel the way a happy new mother feels about her impossible, colicky, restless newborn baby—I just don&#39;t care what it puts me through. Because I adore it. Because it&#39;s mine. Because it looks exactly like me. It can crack my back and make me feel weary and dull and I&#39;ll still love it, because it is mine."
